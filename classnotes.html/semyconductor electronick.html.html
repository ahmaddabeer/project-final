<p><b> energy band in solid</b>
 <ul> <li> a solid contain a large number of atoms pack closely to gather each atom has dicrease set of energy level there are three importent energy band in solid. </li></ul></p> <br>

<h3> <u>classification of solids on the basic of energy band structure:-</u></h3>
<ol> <p><b> <li>conductor</li></b><ul><li>there is no for bidden gap between the valence band and conduction band are ovelapp </li> <b> example=</b> silve,gold metals etc</ul></p>
<p><li>insulater:-</li> <ul> <li> the energy gap between the valence and conduction band is very hight <B> example=</B>glass, rubber, wood,etc</li></ul></p>
<p> <li> semicinductor:-</li><ul> <li> the energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band is very small <b> example=</b> ge, silicon</li></ul></p>

<h3> electrons and holes in semiconductor:-</h3>
<ul> <li> at low tempurature valence band and conduction bands are empty.hence pure semiconductor's are insulator at room tempurature some of the valence electron accoure thermal energy grater than "eg" and cross over into the conduction band.</li>
<li>a vacancy is created in valence band at each band ehere was electron is present before moving to the conduction band.this vacancy is called 'hole' </li>
<li>a hole is a seat of positive charge(+ve) of magnitude equal to the charge of the free electron in the conduction band and the hole created in the valence.the solid there fore lightly conducting and called semiconductor te conductivity of semiconductor's increases with rise in tempurature.<b>example=</b>germanium or silicon</li></ul>
<ul> <li> <b> There are two typs of semicinductor</b></li></ul>
<ol><li> intrinsic semiconductor(pure semiconductor)</li>
<li> extrinsic semicnductor (impure semiconductor)</li>
<ul> <li> intrinsic semiconductor</li></ul>
<li> a pure semiconductor is called intrinsic semiconductor</li>
<ul> <li> <b>si=</b>1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>2</sup></li></ul>
<ul> <li><b>ge=</b> 1s<sup>2</sup>,2s<sup>2</sup>,2p<sup>6</sup>,3s<sup>2</sup>,3p<sup>6</sup>,4s<sup>2</sup>,3d<sup>10</sup>,4p<sup>2</sup>
</li></ul>

<ul><li> atoms of both 'si'or'ge' have four valence tetravalent electron</li></ul>
<ul> <li> <b> note</b> is a semicinductor electron and 'hole' boths constitute current</li></ol>
<ul><li> <b> intrinsic semicinductor:-</b></li></ul>
<ul><li>apure semicinductor(free from any impurity)is called an "intrinsic" semiconductor.its electrical conductivity which arises by the thermal excitation of ekectron from the valence band to the conduction band is called the "intrinsic"conductinitu</li>.</ul>
<ul> <li>pure germanium and pure silicon are important example of intrinsic semiconductor. their electronic cofigurations are as follows:-</li></ul>
<ul> <li> <b>si=</b>1s<sup>2</sup>2s<sup>2</sup>2p<sup>6</sup>3s<sup>2</sup>3p<sup>2</sup></li></ul>
<ul> <li><b>ge=</b> 1s<sup>2</sup>,2s<sup>2</sup>,2p<sup>6</sup>,3s<sup>2</sup>,3p<sup>6</sup>,4s<sup>2</sup>,3d<sup>10</sup>,4p<sup>2</sup>
:- thus atom of both ge & si have four valence ekectrons that is ge&si are both tetravalent</li></ul>

<h3> <u>p-n junction diode</u></h3>
<ul><li>is a basic semiconductor device.it is a semiconductor device.it is a semiconductor form by p-type the boundery beween p-type&n-type is called p-n junction.</li></ul>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/i.ytimg.com/vi/USrY0JspDEg/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="p-n junction" height="200">
<h3>formation of depletion layer at the junction:-</h3>
<ul><li>in a p-n junction diode the p region has holes as a mejority charge carrier and equal number of fixed negative accptor atom . the metarial as hole thus natural</li><li>the n-region has -ve donar ions thus the metarial hole is natural</li><li>as soon as the p-n junction is formthere is an imedeate defusion of the mejoruty charge carrier accros the junction</li><li>some of the electron n-region defuse into the p-region while some of the whole in the p-region</li><li>the defuse charge carrier combination with their counter part near the junction a potential difference setup and internal electric field 'Ei' is stablised</li><li>the region on the either side of the junction which become deplited of the mobile charge-carries is called the deplisation layer</li><li>the potential difference devlop across the deplation region is called the potrntial barrier</li></ul>
<h3>flow of current across the juntion diode:forward & reverce baising of junction:-</h3>
<ul><li>in the absence of any external battery,there is no current in the junction diode. can be connnected biasing and recerse bising of the junction </li></ul>
<ol><li>forward biasing:-</li></ol>
<ul><li>a junction diode id said to be forward-biased when the +ve terminal of the external battery is connected to the p-region and the -ve terminal to the n-region of the diode</li><li>in this situtation, an external electric field e directed from p-region towars n-region is setup in the diode</li><li>in this situtation the field e is much stronger than the opposing internal field "E1".</li><li>hence holes in the p-region,an e <sup>-</sup> in the n-region both move towards the jnction</li><li>thus,the motion of majority-carrier across the junction this is called forward current</li></ul>
<h3>reverse biasing:-</h3>
<ul><li> a junction diode is said to be recersed-biased when the +ve terminal of the externa battery is connected to the n-region and the -ve terminal to the p-region of the diode.</li><li>towards p-region and thus aids the internal barrier field E1</li><li> hence holes in the p-region and electron in the n-region are both pushed away from the junction there is almost no current due to majority carries</li></ul>
<h3><u>#v-i characteristic</u></h3>
<ul><li>in the begining when the applied voltage is low the current to diode almost zero becouse of the potential barrier </li><li>with increase in applied voltage the current increses very slowly not linearli untill the applied voltage the current and almost linearli how the diode we haves as a conductor.</li></ul>

<h3><u>Diode as a rectifier:-</u></h3>
<u>rectifier:-</u>
<ul><li>A rectifier as a device which converts an alternative current (or voltage) into a direct (undirectional)curren (or voltage)</li></ul>
<ol><li>p-n junction diodes as half wave rectifier the current flows throught the diode only during +ve half cycle.</li>
<img src="" alt="">

<u>warking:-</u>
<ul><li>during +ve half cycle the diode is forward biased and conduct</li><li>a current flows through the load RL</li><li>during -ve half cycle the diode is now reverse biased </li><li>there is almaost zero current (or voltage) across the load RL.</li><li>since the output  current corouspond to one half of the input ,the other half being missing the process is called half wave rectifier</li></ul>

<li>p-n junction diode as full wave rectifier:-</li></ol>
<ul><li>two diode is used in full wave rectifie one diode rectifier +ve half cycle and other diode rectifier -ve half cycle.</li></ul>
<img src="" alt="">
<u>warking</u>
<ul><li>during +ve half cyde D1 is forward biased and D2 is reverse biased.there fore D1 conducts whide D2 does not.</li><li>current flows through diode D1 and produces output across the load R1</li><li>during -ve half ciycle diode D1 is reverse biased and D2 is forward biased,therefore D2 conducts while D1 does not.</li><li>current flow throught diode D2 and produces output across the load RL.</li><li>the output current is contineous series of undirectional pulses this process is called full wave rectification. </li></ul>
